## 📖 About This Repository
This repository documents my daily progress, solutions, and key learnings from the **100 Days of Cloud** challenge. My goal is to build a consistent habit of cloud engineering and gain hands-on proficiency in:
- **AWS** (Amazon Web Services)
- **Azure** (Microsoft Azure)
- **Linux & Shell Scripting**
- **Git & DevOps Tools**

Each day's entry includes the task objective, the solution (commands/scripts), and a summary of what I learned.
